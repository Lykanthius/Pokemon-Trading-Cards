Pokémon Trading Cards

This project was created as part of an introductory programming course with Udacity.

The goal was to use an external CSS stylesheet linked to an HTML file to create animal trading cards that showcase nested containers and styling principles.

For this project, I chose to create three Pokémon trading cards. Each card features:

A unique design with background gradients and text styling.
Animated GIFs of the Pokémon to evoke the look and feel of holographic trading cards.

Feel free to explore the code and design to see how the animations and layouts were implemented!
